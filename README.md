- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SokimMan
- ðŸ‘€ I work as an SDET and spend a good portion of my time at work building test automation. We use Java, TestNG, and Selenium for our automation tech stack. Always intrested in learning new frameworks and methods for testing and test automation.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SDL2 for my passion project that I work on in my free time, which is a high fantasy style turn-based strategy-tatics game (similar to fire emblem).
